This section contains the following examples and exercises about control statements:
 - DiceRoll: A D20 dice roller that randomly generates rolls (1-20) for a user given number of times. For each roll the value is output to the console. On a 20 a 'Critical Hit'
is added to the output and on a 1 a 'Oh No' is added. The rolls are summed and after the loop ends an average is calculated
 - ForSum: A basic loop that takes positive integers from the console input until a negative is entered. Upon closing the loop the input numbers are summed and returned
 - JamClub: A 'jam of the month exercise' that takes in a package type (char) and a quantity of jams and calculates the total cost using a simple switch statement
 - NumberGuesser: A simple guesser game that generates a random number (1 - 100) and the user must guess the number. With each guess the user is told if it is too high or too low
 - OddOrEven: Simple exercise that outputs an iterated i value up to a user provided limit and notes if the number is odd or even
 - RetiredW: An exercise that checks a user entered gender (char) and age (int) to check if they qualify for a certain discount
