This section contains the following examples and exercises about Arrays and Vectors:
- AgeTrackingProject: A parallel vector project tracking names and corresponding ages
- ArrayDataProject: Takes 5 integers from the user and stores them in an array. Each value in the array is then doubled and output to the console
- ArrayObjectPractice: Stores the doubles of the values 0-9 in an array. The array is then iterated through and each value prints to the console.
- SimpleArrayPractice: Populates an array with integers and then iterats through the array and prints the data to the console
- TwoDimArrayPractice: Creates a 2-dimensional array, prints the array and prints the array reversed
- VectorDataProject: Takes non-negative integers from the user until a negative is entered. The values are added to a vector. If the vector is empty notify the user
otherwise, output the double of each value in the vector
- VectorPractice: Creates a vector of names, inserts a name as the third element in the vector, removes the last element in the vector and prints the remaining vector
